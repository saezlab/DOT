# Sample reference scRNA-seq and spatial data

Sample reference scRNA-seq and synthetic multicell spatial data of the
primary motor cortex region (MOp) of the mouse brain. The reference
single-cell RNA seq sample comes from a similar region and contains 44
cell types. Both spatial and single-cell data are down-sampled to 500
genes in this example.

## Usage

``` r
data(dot.sample)
