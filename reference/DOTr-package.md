# DOTr: A flexible multi-objective optimization framework for transferring features across single-cell and spatial omics

DOT is a method for transferring cell features from a reference
single-cell RNA-seq data to spots/cells in spatial omics. It operates by
optimizing a combination of multiple objectives using a Frank-Wolfe
algorithm to produce a high quality transfer. Apart from transferring
cell types/states to spatial omics, DOT can be used for transferring
other relevant categorical or continuous phenotypes from one set of
omics to another, such as estimating the expression of missinng genes or
transferring transcription factor/pathway activities.
